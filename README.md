# mac-passwords-app
An app that allows you to view keychain passwords with one click.

How it works: opens the passwords prefPane

**WORKS IN macOS 12 (Monterey) and above**

If you use macOS Big sur or older, try my older app (it is only tested on Big Sur, but it should work for macOS a bit older)
